## Problem Statement

given in a grid, a starting row, and a starting column. In the grid, "X"s are walls,
* "O"s are open spaces, and "C"s are carrots. The method should return a number representing the length of the shortest path
* from the starting position to a carrot. You may move up, down, left, or right, but cannot pass through walls (X).
* If there is no possible path to a carrot, then return -1.
