## Problem Description

given an array board consisting of R strings of length C, returns the number of rectangles with a corner at position (0, 0) covering an equal number of letters A and B.

Examples:

1. For board=["AB.", "B..", ".. A"], the function should return 5, as explained above.

2. For board=["A.", "AB"], there are no rectangles that satisfy the given conditions. The function should return 0.

3. For board=["..A","A","A"], the function should return 9. All valid rectangles that do not cover letters satisfy the given conditions.
